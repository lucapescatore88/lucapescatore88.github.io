    			<p style="text-align:left;margin:20px">
    				Here is a sliding puzzle game. With automatic solver!
    				The graphics is done with 
    				<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm"><code>TKinter</code></a>
    				(as in all other programs).
    				I made this little program while learning the 
    				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search algorithm</a>.
    				In fact to solve the puzzle the program goes to a tree of possible moves
    				searching for the winning branch. Checking all possible branches
    				can be extremely computationally expensive. The A* algorithm boosts the search in the following way:
    			</p>
    				<ul style="text-align:left;margin:20px">
    					<li>Book-keeping: if a move was already expanded do not expand it again;</li>
    					<li>Guided search: we can evaluate the distance to the goal and expand nodes with a smaller distance first.
    					<br>For example one can use the number of misplaced tiles as an estimate.
    					<br>In this case a <a href="https://heuristicswiki.wikispaces.com/Manhattan+Distance">Manhattan distance</a>
    					heuristic is used.
    					</li>
    			    </ul>
    			<p style="text-align:left;margin:20px">Note that the search is limited at 10000 iterations
    			(takes about 10-15 seconds on my Mac). It successfully solved boards with up to 31 moves to reach
    			the goal. But in quite some situations more than ~30 moves are required. In that case it won't find a solution.
    			You can try to help it a bit though putting at least the easy boxes in place!
    			It will lower a lot the search space. </p>

    			I was at <a href="http://moriond.in2p3.fr"> Moriond</a> conference some time ago 
    			and there was a challenge: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku"> sudoku</a> to solve.
    			It was a really really hard one! So I decided to practice my newly learned graphics skills
    			to implement a sudoku with solving helper. The helper fills all numbers which
    			have a defined unique value. It does this by going though each box and finding which
    			numbers can go in a box. If only one can work the number is added.
    			The algorithm simply continues looping over all boxes until no move is possible any more.
    			This does not always solve the sudoku. Often it comes a moment were no box has a unique possibility.
    			In that case you can try find a number or just fill one of the empty boxes at random and then try the
    			solve button again! Never mind, if you go wrong you can always go back!
    			And by the way: I did it! I soved it. In just 2 days starting from scratch. But I was beaten by a human solver.

    			<ul style="text-align:left;margin:20px">
    				<li> Used TKinter to let you browse images and open them</li>
    				<li> Uses PIL to resize the image to a 160x160 square and make it black and white</li>

    			<p style="text-align:left;margin:20px">
    			In my work as a PhD in physics I did a lot of data analysis and we used
    			many machine learning tools such as 
    			<a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html">Neural Networks</a> 
    			and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">Boosted Decision Trees</a>.
    			but I was really bugged by the fact that they were just black boxes to me.
    			So I decided to build a BDT! This program let't you load sets of points
    			some categorised as "signal" and "background". Then it uses a BDT to find the
    			best separation between them. A neural network is also on the way but not ready
    			yet so don't push the "Neural Net" button!!
    			Before going to the facts I must acknowledge who taught me about machine learning which is

    			<p style="text-align:left;margin:20px">
    			In high energy physics experiments we are all about tracking. Particles are very little and not
    			visible by eye. But when they traverse silicon they leave bunches of free electrons behing which can
    			be detected. So what we actually see is a series of "hits" in various silicon layers which we have to
    			put together to reconstruct the track of the particle and from that it's properties.
    			This little program defines a geometri of 20 layers and you can produce hits.
    			You can decide how many track to have in the same event and you can add noise.
    			Finally pushing "Analyse" an algorithm is run that identifies tracks.
    			You can find details about how it works <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3466v1.pdf"> here</a>.
    			The basic idea is to make a grid of all possible track parameters and weight them 
    			depending on how close those tracks would be to the hits we have. This produced peaks in the
    			reatina which can be used to identify tracks. This is not a software-level efficient algorithm
    			but it is very simple and can he implemented in hardware.

    			For the EPFL open day I was asked to make a little program to explain the Rutherford
    			experiment to kids. This experiment is about the structure of the atom.
    			Physicists believed that the atom was a uniformly filled sphere and Rutherford wanted 
    			to test this hypothesis. He threw alpha particles at gold atoms and found that
    			some would go though while others would rebound. This can be explained

    			the planetary model of the atom was born! The program simulates the experiment
    			by throwing marbles at shapes of different form. Can you spot which shape it is

    			The game is also available in 4 languages!
